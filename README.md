# Penny_Pinchers_Warehouse_Manager

Hello! If you're reading this I want you to know this code is not entirely functional!

This code is limited by java's limitations and cannot do what it set out to do.

Java has a limitation in that I cannot use a user input to name an object

I have uploaded this file to GitHub so that I can use it to convert the code to a language that supports this action.
